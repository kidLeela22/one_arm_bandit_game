# one_arm_bandit_game
This is a console based game. The one arm bandit is a classic slot machine game (the "arm") used to spin the reels. Players insert money, pull the arm, and try to match symbols along a payline to win prizes. The nickname comes from the lever's single “arm” and the fact that it can quickly “rob” players of their money if luck isn’t on their side.
